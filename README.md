# Unity WebGL Optimizer

The purpose of this package is to help you optimize your game by reducing the build size and increasing the performance. At the moment, it is targeted at WebGL games.

If you are using our CrazySDK, this package will come integrated with it.

Minimum required versions:

- C# 6.0
- Unity 2019

Once you have imported the package from GitHub, or our SDK which also contains this tool, it will be accessible in the `Tools > WebGL Optimizer` menu option.

## Export optimizations

The export optimizations tab contains a checklist of options that should be correctly set to improve the performance and decrease the bundle size of your WebGL game.

## Texture optimizations

The texture optimizations tool provides an overview of all the textures in your project, and also various tips about optimizing the size they occupy in the final build.

It finds textures in your project in these 2 ways:

1. By looking at the scenes included in the build (Build settings > Scenes in build), and finding recursively all the textures on which those scenes depend.
2. By finding textures in `Resources` folders, or by recursively finding textures on which the assets from the Resources folders depend.

This means that the texture detection may miss more intricate textures that are not covered by the above cases.

You can toggle the "Include files from Packages" options to also display textures from the installed packages, for example from Package Manager.

## Model optimizations

The model optimizations tool works very similar to the texture optimizations tool, but instead of textures it finds models in your project and provides various tips about optimizing them.

## Audio clip optimizations

The audio clip optimizations tool works very similar to the texture optimizations tool, but instead of textures it finds audio clips in your project and provides various tips about optimizing them.

## Build logs analyzer

The build logs analyzer parses the Editor.log file to extract the list of files included in your build and the space they occupy. You can use this utility to furthermore analyze the files included in your project.

Similar to the texture optimizer, you can toggle the "Include files from Packages" options to also display textures from the installed packages, for example from Package Manager.
